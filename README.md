(Added README for [Hack Club Arcade](https://hackclub.com/arcade/))

# Story, I guess (idk what im doing)

This repo, or more specifically the /morpheme folder in this repo is a WIP PWA for recording constructed languages (conlangs). While there are a few alternatives, including (but not limited to) [ConWorkShop](https://conworkshop.com/) and [PolyGlot](https://draquet.github.io/PolyGlot/), none have been able to do what I wanted them to do. So, essentially, Morpheme is a mashup of the existing programs for creating conlangs in React app form, but built from scratch & customized by me. Honestly there's really not a great reason for why it exists but I wanted to learn React and how to set up a PWA so that I can contribute to my robotics team's scouting app.

(_The repo is part of my personal website but I haven't even started planning the rest of it, if the requirement is 1 repo per Arcade project just count this as part of my personal website pls, ty!_)

(_Also note that [https://liujip0.github.io/](https://liujip0.github.io/) currently doesn't work, only [https://liujip0.github.io/morpheme](https://liujip0.github.io/morpheme) does. I will fix this at some point in the future, but rn I'm just working on the /morpheme folder so it isn't rly a huge problem_)
