(Added README for [Hack Club Arcade](https://hackclub.com/arcade/))
# Story, I guess
This repo, or more specifically the /morpheme folder in this repo is a WIP PWA (except I haven't added the PWA part so its just a web app rn) for recording constructed languages (conlangs). While there are a few alternatives, including (but not limited to) [ConWorkShop](https://conworkshop.com/) and [PolyGlot](https://draquet.github.io/PolyGlot/), none have been able to do what I wanted them to do. So, essentially, Morpheme is a mashup of the existing programs for creating conlangs in React app form, but built from scratch & customized by me. Honestly there's really not a great reason for why it exists but I wanted to learn React so that I can contribute to my robotics team's scouting app.

(*The repo is part of my personal website but I haven't even started planning the rest of it, if the requirement is 1 repo per Arcade project just count this as part of my personal website pls, ty!*)
